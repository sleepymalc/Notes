\section{Shortest Paths with Negative Lengths}
\subsection{Reals Weights}
In the following two lectures, we will discuss a recent breakthrough of single-source shortest path with negative length \cite{huang2024fastersinglesourceshortestpaths}, which can now be solved in \(\widetilde{O} (mn^{4 / 5})\). This is built upon the recent work that first break the \(\widetilde{O} (mn)\) bound that achieves \(\widetilde{O} (mn^{8 / 9})\) ~\cite{fineman2024single}.
